# Badge

Badges contain small amounts of information that help provide additional 
context for a larger piece of content. Context could be describing the 
content's state, status, or other pertinent meta-information. 

An example of a badge could be a count for updates, or a status of "new". 
Badges are not to be confused with tags or input labels. Tags and input labels
could contain badges, however.
